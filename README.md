# Caffeine

## Description:

This project was a basic analysis of a data set. The data set can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heitornunes/caffeine-content-of-drinks. This data compares different drinks and their caffeine content. It's columns are drink (which is the drinks name), Volume (ml), Calories, Caffiene (mg), and drink type. The drink types are coffee, energy drinks, energy shots, soft drinks, tea, and water. There were no null entries in the data.

My goal for this project is to make models to see if the algorithm can predict what type of drinks it is, based on a few key details given to us by the data set.
